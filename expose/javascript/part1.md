1. Line 9 prints 'values added: 20'.
2. Line 13 prints 'final result: 20'.
3. var has no block scope no even if var is defined in a block, it can be accessed outside of the block.
4. Line 9 prints 'values added: 20'.
5. ReferenceError: result is not defined. This is because let variables are block-scoped so it is only accessible inside the block that the let variable is defined. This is why 'values added: 20' is printed but the error occurs outside the if the block.
6. TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. This is because the const keyword makes the variable not able to be changed after its declaration. When we try to assign result with num1 and num2, the const variable raises the error.
7. Line 13 is never reached because of the type error from line 9, so nothing is printed.
