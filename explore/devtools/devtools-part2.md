1. The bug was that when input 2 numbers and calculate, the init calls on printSum which converts the two numbers to strings. Then in calculateSum() the two strings are concatenated instead of using its integer values.
2. After retreiving the inputs, i would use built in functions like Number(). This would convert both integers and decimals instead of just integers if we used something like parseFloat().
